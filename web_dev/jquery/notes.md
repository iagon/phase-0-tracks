#### Plan

I hope to open find a docs for jquery and briefly glance over some topics. After a broad overview of jquery I will search for a jquery tutorials. I hope to find a problem based tutorial to assist in testing while learning. At only two hours no real break is needed, but perhaps around the 75 minute mark I will do something for a minute or two to give the eyes a rest from the computer screen. 


#### Results

I found W3schools tutorial which I remember from html/css days. They offer a nice way to test concepts out with examples. The docs although very extensive weren't all that helpful for a beginner.
