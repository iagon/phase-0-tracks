##### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux was designed assuming every user of their OS would be computer literate. It never assumes that the user is incompetent. Because of this Linux allows everyone the maximum amount of power(nothing is withheld or hidden behind inflexible GUI's). This allows the user to do anything whether it be a good or unintentionally bad. Other 'tenets' of the Linux philosophy include: -Small is Beautiful -Each Program Does One Thing Well -Prototype as Soon as Possible -Choose Portability Over Efficiency

##### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is virtual machine that can be accessed remotely. A VPS runs its own copy of an OS which the user can control. The advantages are lower cost than dedicated hosting, greater accessibility and control because the OS is under your control.

##### Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It is a safety concern. You're system will be more exposed to bugs and errors. Also if you run applications in root they then have access to the whole system. It is better practice to create a separate user to keep the root intact.
