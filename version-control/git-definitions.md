# Git Definitions :) 

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict


1. Version control allows for all changes made to a file to be saved over time. It provides the ability to track, modify and understand all versions and changes that have been made to the file. 

2. A branch is a copy from an original repo or master branch. It allows for changes to be made without affecting the master branch. (Until commit and merge is made)

3. A commit upload changes made to a file. A good commit message details what has been changed. 

4. A merge conflict occurs when git is unable to merge paths. This can be the result of a few instances. Most notably when two changes are made to the same line on the same file.
